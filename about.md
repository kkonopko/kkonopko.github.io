Professionally, I am a software engineer.  I like simplicity and I believe
software _engineering_ is not only about getting things done, but also finding
the simplest means of getting things
done. [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

I also try to remain pragmatic.  I believe it is required to understand matters
in order to come up with simple solutions.  It frustrates me if I have no time
or brainpower to deeply understand the problem I'm working on.  Yet I'm only a
human so I'm trying to allow myself to remain dumb!  Please forgive me if you
see something dumb here.  I'm always keen to learn!
